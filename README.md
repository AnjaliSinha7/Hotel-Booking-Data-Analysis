**Notebook Walkthrough**

The Jupyter Notebook (hotel_booking_analysis.ipynb) walks through the following steps:

Data Loading: Loading the dataset using Pandas.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, converting data types, and preparing the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the data through descriptive statistics, visualizations, and identifying trends, correlations, and anomalies.
Data Visualization: Creating informative visualizations to communicate key findings effectively.
**
Key Findings**

A strong positive correlation was found between lead time and cancellation rate, suggesting that bookings made further in advance are more likely to be canceled.
